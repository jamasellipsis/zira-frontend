Good morning everybody,

I am Anderson Castiblanco and I belong to Ellipsis team. We are a team of 5 talented developers.
Let me begin with some hard data: In 2018 almost 2.5 million students joined university programs in Colombia. Now, in 2020, due to COVID-19 a similar quantity of students is taking their classes through a screen, and teachers are struggling and trying to adapt their classes to the new reality. Now imagine how many people is in the same situation just in Latin America.
When I was in my university, I really enjoyed the 15 minutes before and after the class, it was a natural networking and the way for getting new friends. I enjoyed the classroom and the blackboard, my classmates’ opinions and expressions, these elements enriched my learning process.
But virtual classes as we know them, haven’t integrated all these elements in order to make me feel like in a real classroom. Despite I’ve adapted to pre-recorded classes or asynchronous education models, I really miss the physical classroom and I know, many of you too.
